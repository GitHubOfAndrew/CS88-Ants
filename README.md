# CS88-Ants
A game created in CS88: Computational Structures in Data Science.  It is the source code for the game: Ants vs. Some Bees (an obvious rip off of Plants vs. Zombies).

ants.py is the file that is responsible for the core mechanics of the game.  It includes all the actions of the ants and bees.  The other .py files are to generate the user interface and load the assets.
